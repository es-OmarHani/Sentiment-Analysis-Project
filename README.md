# Sentiment Analysis Modeling Approaches

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation of sentiment analysis using both traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning approaches.

Specifically, it covers:
- Traditional Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting.
- Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis using various architectures including BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer, and hybrid models.
- Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis using DistilBERT.
